Twitter has had a series of major setbacks due to the recent takeover by Elon Musk. The [nearly half of their staff has been fired](https://gizmodo.com/musk-twitter-layoffs-1849751286), the [new verification system rollout was a disaster](https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/here-are-some-of-the-verified-fake-twitter-accounts-overtaking-the-platform-1.6150691), and they [are losing ad revenue at an alarming rate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitters-advertising-exodus-accelerates-despite-outreach-from-elon-musk-11668262920). There is a very real possibility that Twitter as we know it will cease to exist in the near future.

For many of us Twitter has been a source of news, entertainment, and community. If the social network collapses what will happen to the connections we've made? Where will we all go? For hundreds of thousands of people around the world (so far) the answer has been to join a Mastodon server.

This is where Flatlander comes in. We would like to offer people an online home where they can reconnect with the network of people they established on Twitter. The plan at a high level looks like this:

1. Reach out to the existing community on Twitter and collect contact information of everyone that's interested in migrating to a new online home.
2. Based on the level of interest from people, and the current state of open source solutions (Mastodon, Pleroma, etc), we will select software that best fits our needs and a hosting provider.
3. We will then establish an open and transparent funding mechanism for the hosting costs (community donations).
4. We launch the server and invite everyone over!

There is plenty more to talk about but this the first step! In the meantime feel free to [submit your contact information](/sign-up) and we will keep you posted on any major developments!

Thank you, 

Joel
