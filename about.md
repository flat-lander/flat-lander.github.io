Flatlander will be a micro-blogging social network powered by free and open source software. You will be able to connect to friends on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/), and other [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) compliant hosts.

Stay tuned for updates here as we approach the launch of our server, and [join our mailing list](/sign-up) to be notified of any major updates along the way. We have a lot of work to do until then!
